Gagarin is a service for creating and managing chatbots and agents. You can choose your LLM providers and your prompts.
Your agents can interact with the world around them through tools. Using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) they
can learn about various topics, including your privately hosted data.

## ‚ú® Use cases

Gagarin lets you add and manage different LLM providers in a uniform way. You can create agents, give them prompts, 
determine which tools and information they can access, and chat with them from any interface you want. You can use
the model that is best for your use case without worrying about lock-in.


## üëÄ Features:

- Add LLM providers
- Create agents with specific prompts
- Give those agents access to specific tools
- Give those agents access to specific information
- Create as many agents or instances of those agents as you'd like
- Create and interact with agents programmatically through a simple API, or use an SDK
